      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wanted to travel somewhere but you were not sure where was the best place for you or what different places have to offer? This website will give information on many different places to travel, common and uncommon destinations. It will have details on the best places to stay, with options of B&B’s, hotels, resorts, etc. So that you know the scoop on all the options. We also seek out at least one local’s insights on the best places to visit, because they are the ones that really know what’s best there and the most familiar with it. Our travel experts have travelled abroad and have lots of personal knowledge and experience about the way to organize your trip and plan it the way you’ll enjoy most. While giving the details about different places that is the best fit for your trip. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The people that most would want to find good places to travel is adults. Young adults don’t often have the responsibilities of a family yet, so they can go wherever with a friend or something. Older adults like to travel to show their family the world as well. So, we can include options for both situations. Showing good options for family trips or good places for individual travelling. Places that kids have really loved travelling to, or places for if you like learning about the history of an area or culture, or if you’re a thrill-seeker. Adults want to see the world more and more likely have the money to do so. Can also cater to the higher price ranges vs lower price ranges, as adults can be at any different point on that scale. </p>  <!-- change this -->
